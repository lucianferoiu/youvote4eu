		<h2>Welcome to the Partners Platform section of <span class="text-primary">YouVoteForEurope</span></h2>
		<p> </p>
		<p>We count on your help to improve the quality of the questions we present to the EU citizens.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Editing and refining the text and details of the questions proposed by you or other partners,
			 is of great value to the public so your well-thought contributions will be prized by us all!</p>
		<p>Your help will be especially appreciated in providing translations for the existing questions, so that all European citizens can easily understand the problems and contextual details of the various topics under public scrutiny. Our goal is to present the topics in a clear, concise and spin-free manner so that we can make well-informed decisions as citizens and participants in our democratic system.</p>
		<p>You may propose new questions on topics that you believe are of interest to many EU citizens.</p>
		<p>Likewise, you may upvote the questions you value so once they gain enough support and with enough completed details we may publish them. Afterwards, all European citizens may express their stance on those issues and signal to our representatives of the change we actually want to happen in the EU.</p>
