				Hello and thank you for coming back to <i>YouVoteForEurope</i>!
			</p>
			<p>
				You asked us to reset your password and you provided a new one. But to finalize the process, you need to confirm to us the reset.
			</p>
			<p>
				If it was not you who attempted the reset, please <strong>do not click the link bellow</strong>! 
				It may mean someone tryed to hijack your account! 
				Please go to <em>YouVoteForEurope</em> and <strong>re-reset</strong> the password yourself, because the old one may be compromised.
				<br/>
				If this suspicious password reset happends again, please contact us so we can investigate...
			</p>
			<p>
				<br/>
				To <strong>confirm</strong> the reset, <a href="${url}">please click here</a>.
				If you're unable to see the link or cannot open the link in your browser, copy this<br/>
				<tt>${url}</tt><br/>
				in the address bar of a browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				Make sure to do so in the next 24h, since afterwards the code will be deleted and the password resetting process halted.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br/>
				Thank you,<br/>
				The <i>YouVoteForEurope</i> team.
