Marie-Ana meets Bazu who’s coming back from Foggia with the Mustang P51

A busy aerodrome.  All kinds of planes come and go. A few days ago, Romania turned the weapons against the Germans and everyone is a bit confused. At some point three American planes turn around the aerodrome. All pilots, mechanics and personnel look at them wondering what is that they want.
MARIE-ANA:
What are these?
PILOT1:
American planes, Mustangs P-51s. The best combat planes at this hour.
MARIE-ANA:
Better than the Messerschmitts?
PILOT1:
Apparently so. I did not fight against them but, those who did, confirmed that they are superior. They have more engine power and are very maneuverable. They fly comfortably at very high altitudes as well. It’s true they are also coming in great numbers, making them hard to shoot down, but they are very good planes.
MARIE-ANA:
What are they doing here?
PILOT1:
I really don’t know. But after the recent turn of events, they are our new allies. I guess they do have a mission here already.
One of the planes lands, whilst the others continue to turn around. The pilot gets out and fires up a flaring rocket. The two other planes leave. Everyone starts running towards the plane when they realize the pilot is Bazu. Marie-Ana is among them as well.
PILOT1:
What are you doing, crazy guy? Where are you coming from in an American airplane?
BAZU:
From their military base in Foggia, Italy. Hey Marie-Ana, you’re here as well!
MARIE-ANA:
Yeah, I brought a medical plane for revision and I was having a small talk with some comrades. You surprised us with your disguised arrival.
BAZU:
You should have seen the surprise I made the Americans. I will enjoy this scene for the rest of my life.
MARIE-ANA:
Stop teasing us and tell us what’s going on.
BAZU:
I cannot tell you too much, for it was a diplomatic mission. I had to bring a high rank American prisoner of war to Foggia. I flew there with a Messerchmitt G, with the American guy hidden in the plane’s fuselage.
PILOT1:
Where the heck did you put the guy? Even the pilot’s place is rather tight.
BAZU:
It was a bit complicated, yeah. We had to take out the radio station. So I had been flying completely deaf. But the trip went smoothly.
PILOT2:
And you did land the Messerschmitt on an American aerodrome!
BAZU:
I had to do it. That was the mission. He start laughing.
PILOT2:
This is absolutely crazy! It’s a miracle they didn’t shoot you down! Only you could have done something like this!
BAZU:
Well, the plane had the US flag on it and my passenger did let me know before leaving a set of recognition signs in order to show them I’m not what I seem to be, an enemy plane.
PILOT1:
Did you use them?
BAZU:
Yes. But I don’t know if they noticed them. Cause I did not get the impression they saw me until I was close to the ground. I landed and they came with their guns asking me “Who are you?”, “What are you doing here?”. I get out of the cockpit smiling and tell them “I have a surprise for you.”
PILOT2:
The first surprise was that you speak their language, I suppose.
BAZU:
Yeah, but that was nothing compared to their faces when their officer was pulled out of the fuselage! They couldn’t believe their eyes. They thought him lost, of course. They exploded in cheers and took us both on arms to the commandment buildings where they opened a few bottles of champagne.
PILOT2:
Fine people, the Americans! Too bad they were not around in the beginning of the war, to have them as allies.
PILOT1:
That would have been a more understandable alliance than the latest one with our neighbours in the East!
BAZU:
Indeed, fine guys, the Americans. I had a great time. I even received the proposal to join the US Airforce, in jest, of course.
MARIE-ANA:
What happened to the Messerschmitt? Did you leave it there as a present?
BAZU:
Haha, no. It had to be refueled, but they did not have the proper gear. After they managed to refuel, some pilots wanted to try it. One of them broke it at landing. So they gave me the Mustang to come back.
PILOT1:
Yeah, to make everyone envious here. Did they train you on the Mustang?
BAZU:
Well, a little bit. But it is a fine plane, I needed two flights to get to know it. When I left I couldn’t help it and tried one or two aerobatics. As a goodbye!
MARIE-ANA:
What an adventure! It’s a great story to tell the nephews! And what will happen now?
BAZU:
I don’t know, dear! I’m just the messenger. What I sniffed is that they want to take out of the country the rest of prisoners, around one thousand people. But I guess that has to be further negociated with our war ministry, the diplomatic representatives and so on.
